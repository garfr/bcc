# The Beans Cool Compiler 

Beans is an extremely work in progress low-level programming language designed with simplicity and powerful low level control in mind. 
It resembles Rust in syntax, with the semantic of C, sans the 50 years of bad ideas.  
The language is extremely primitive in its current form, and can't do anything useful.
