# The Beans Cool Compiler 

Beans is an extremely work in progress low-level programming language designed with simplicity and powerful low level control in mind. 

Currently, the focus of developments is on the frontend, and the backend does not work properly, if it even compiles for any given commit.  I decided that adding new features to the frontend would require constant rewriting and refactoring of the backend, so I have put it on pause for now.  

It resembles Rust in syntax, with the semantic of C, sans the 50 years of bad ideas.  
The language is extremely primitive in its current form, and can't do anything useful.  
If you find it at all interesting and want to contribute, you can checkout todo.md or just send me a PM.
